# OPT

## မလျှောက်ခင် ဖတ်ရန်

- Please follow the instructions carefully; this is very important to avoid any delays in submitting your application.

- Before you begin you must be certain that you have officially graduated from MIU. This means that you contacted csgraduation@miu.edu, applied for graduation and were approved and your degree was conferred BEFORE your anticipated STEM start date. The STEM start date is always the day after the OPT expires. Note that graduation at MIU occurs twice per year, in June and in December. For you, this means you MUST have graduated no later than 06/21/2025. If you have not yet received your diploma due to still having some financial obligation to MIU, you must order an official transcript and enrollment verification letter from the registrar’s office to submit with your STEM application in lieu of your diploma. You can order these documents here: Transcript Request | Maharishi University (miu.edu).

- Please visit the STEM OPT Hub to learn more about the rules and regulations for OPT and STEM OPT https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub and sevpstemoptreportingrequirementsfinal.pdf (dhs.gov) to learn more about reporting requirements on STEM OPT. Please also share these links with your employer.

- STEM OPT can be applied for no earlier than 90 days before your OPT expires, or as late as your OPT expiration date. Provided that your application arrives at USCIS before your OPT expires, you are legally allowed to continue working for up to 180 days while USCIS processes your STEM application.

- To apply for the STEM OPT extension, you must properly file the Form I-765 with the correct application fee ($470) and required evidence, which is outlined in the attached documents. Please note that you MUST be physically present in the U.S. to submit your application to USCIS.

- The next step is for you to complete the Form I-983 Training Plan for STEM with your supervisor. You can download the Form I-983 here: ICE Form I-983. Please refer to the I-983 Training Plan Instructions attached to this email while completing the form. When entering the DSO information on your Form I-983 please use the following:
  -- Someone from MIU
  -- Phone number provided by MIU
  -- opt@miu.edu

- \*\*\*Avoid this common I-983 error: The employment start date on page 2 should match the STEM OPT requested start date, not your original start date from post-completion OPT.

- The key aspect of the STEM OPT extension is that there MUST be a direct relationship between the employee and the employer so that the employer can exercise control over the activities of the employee and can execute the Training Plan. Therefore, only the E-Verified employer that provides the actual training relevant to the student’s qualifying STEM degree is authorized to sign and complete the Form I-983.

See drop-down under section: STEM OPT Employer Requirements and Responsibilities.

- When your Form I-983 Training Plan is ready, please email it to opt@miu.edu. Follow the instructions in the STEM Online Application Checklist and STEM OPT Extension I-765 Online Filing Guide and send us a draft of your Form I-765 once you have it. All documents can be sent together.

- Once we have reviewed your I-765 and it is found to be complete and correct we will then issue you an updated STEM I-20 03/20/2025. DO not make the mistake of submitting your application online before you receive, sign and upload this new I-20. If you submit without it, your application will be DENIED.

- Please note: MIU charges a $600 STEM fee for the continued monitoring and maintenance of your F-1 record. This is in addition to the $470 to the Department of Homeland Security for the filing of the Form I-765.

- You can visit https://students.miu.edu/finances/payment to pay the $600 fee to MIU. Click on the first option (Tuition, Housing, Meals...) and proceed with your payment from there. Send a screenshot of the payment made, along with all other documents. We will be checking your student account to make sure payment has been made before we issue you the updated STEM I-20. \*\*We recommend paying by credit card, as E-Check payments may take up to a week to clear.
