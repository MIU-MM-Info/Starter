# Overview of the whole Journey

## Resume / cover letter update

- Watched a lot of resume preparation from youtube. There are many great resources, especially those working (or worked) at MAANG companies. (MIU resume recommendations, their template and ideology, all very terribly suck, I wonder who came up with such ideas, for example, having certain number of bullet points for each working experiences)
- my idea is simple, it is best to be natural and honest, everyone will have different experiences in different timelines. E.g. someone worked at a company for 6 years and worked on one big project using stable technologies where one was involved since the very early stages and eventually got promotions and stuck in the comfort zone) while person B worked for a start up for 3 years and developed state of the art features in three different domains using latest technologies

## LinkedIn Portfolio

- Updated work experience section to reflect exactly as my resume
- Updated header using ChatGPT
- Asked for recommendations from ex-colleagues, especially those at a management position (the higher ranks they hold the more attractive your LinkedIn profile will be)
- Added certifications and personal projects (I foresee and also got many advices from friends, those would play a major role in job search, so I prepared four-five months in advance while I was studying on-campus)
- One more thing I’d like to point out is what many job seekers adding completion of some learning experiences from udemy, freecodecamp, linkedIn learning, etc, doesn’t make any sense, which recruiters or hiring personnel don’t care at all. We can learn anywhere, from a friend or a CEO, but we should take accredited certifications from Amazon, Oracle, Cisco, etc. However, certifications are also simply for job-search. Technical knowledge will only become applicable if we practice our heart out.

## Skills review and upgrade

- After the first 40-50 rejections, I reviewed my skillset against Systems Analyst role demands and found out there’s one big natural difference between US and Singapore. In Singapore, public sector digital transformation is very aggressive and detailed which enforces the application of mixed technologies with fully customization (e.g. C++, C#, Java) that creates many opportunities for C#/Java based Systems Analyst roles while US public sector relatively is far behind in terms of digitization, so very little or no opportunities for my target roles are created on daily basis.
- I had no choice but to survive, I brushed up my Dynamic CRM knowledge that I used to work with a long time ago and took a fundamental CRM certification from Microsoft. And I resume job applications focused on Dynamic CRM Analyst positions.
- I also revised advanced SQL concepts such as performance optimization. (if you want a technical analyst role, SQL is a must)
- Shortly after, I got many screening calls and interviews.

## Work Authorization

- When I first started out, I simply used F1 status and CPT work authorization for every screening (phone and email). I realized every single recruiter or an HR person who just lost interest or honestly expressed that they don’t just hire F1. It might probably be because of my role. However, the idea MIU gave us to practice a stupid sentence like “Eligible for full time W2 under CPT…..”, didn’t work at all for me. Eligible or not eligible, full time or lifetime, CPT is simply a disaster for me and I would never have come to MIU if I had known such complications.
- I changed my work authorization to GC EAD and after that, screening calls always go to the next step (actual interview with someone from the company)

## Interview preparation

- SPS and star question concepts taught by MIU career team really helped. I didn’t apply how-to cuz their how-to are meaningless and stupid, but all what to prepare, their checklist to nail a behavioral interview is very complete and helpful.
- Dig as much as you can, the company website, domain, their history, reviews by current/ex-employees, their competitors, even their financials.
- Mock interviews with technical and non-technical persons
- Practiced the technologies from JD such as dynamic CRM, SQL, Rest API design and implementation.
- Study their domain (read a book, watch a YouTube or talk to a friend who knows the domain)
- Software engineering practices (this is a must for everyone in tech including analysts) such as SOLID principles, TDD, and design patterns.
- Data visualization, Power BI or Tableau (this is also sort of essential for an analyst)
- Some cloud computing concepts (Storage like Amazon S3, API integration like Amazon API GW, VM like Amazon EC2, CI/CD tools such as Azure devops) in any providers (AWS and Azure is the most popular and dominant)
- Be ready to strike relevant counter questions that make you stand out from the crowd and eliminates many potential questions (as they assume you know it already) to the interviewers:
  o How do you handle reverse logistics? when I had an interview with IT Manager from Retail Pharmacy.
  o Is there any AI integration for CRM Online like Co-pilot?
  Hiring process
- For an analyst role, 90% of the potential employers are the companies that run the actual business (direct hire, not the staffing or agencies)
- First step is screening call or email with some questions or video recording links (where I record myself answering their questions)
- Next steps are variable, some companies arrange with a hiring manager with the authority to make the hiring decisions, some with an architect (big role, huge salary but no authority), or some even with a bunch of persons.
- Usually two to three steps (start to end)

## Tips

- Be realistic when comparing your skillset against JD. I, myself sometimes applied somehow when I know like only 50-60 percent of the JD that will never make it. 80% and above is mandatory for an analyst role (I’m not familiar with other roles)
- Work authorization really play a big role to get an interview (only a few exceptions exist for someone with 10 years of experience with deep architecture and technology knowledge)
- When you get an interview, technical and non-technical preparation are both equally important. We usually take serious about technical stuff and should never forget the role of our interpersonal skills. E.g. I did an interview with a senior architect, and he was barely interested in my past experiences and skills, what he’s more keen to know is who I really am. He asked things like “What do I do outside of work? My hobbies? Relationships with senior and junior colleagues?”. Practice more and try to be as natural as you can.
- Practice coding in any OO language for backend and their respective frameworks (C++, C# .Net or Java Spring boot), even though higher level languages like python are popular.
- Do project-based learning for a front-end tech (such as ReactJs or Angular)

## Statistics

- Applications: 250 (Estimated, I lost track after 150 applications)
- Screening calls: 20
- Technical assessment: 5
- Interviews: 4
